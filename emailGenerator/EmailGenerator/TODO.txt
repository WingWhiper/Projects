Maybe integrate pathlib, make the generated email text files go to a new folder.

Need to refactor the code a bit more, lot of redundancy and better ways things could be done.

PM Update
More refactoring, removed redundant variable assignments.
Troubleshooting the extra empty lines in the text file, the file is making 556 lines total.
What is causing the loop to run 556 times?
Generating 557 emails gave me 15,436 empty lines. There's some math here that can pinpoint the problem.
1 email gave 29 total lines.
2 emails gave 52 lines.
3 gave 81 lines.
