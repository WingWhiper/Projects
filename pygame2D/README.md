This is a finished tutorial project that was an introduction to the pygame library. I did not come up with any of this code.
I did code along with the video to add my own comments explaining how some features work within the library.
It should be noted that some of the comments may be no longer applicable, due to the progression of the video.
The content began in a functional programing style then transitioned to a more OOP style.
